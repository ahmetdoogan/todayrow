# Notification Sounds

Place a file named `notification.mp3` in this directory to enable sound notifications for the Pomodoro timer.

This sound will play when:
- A Pomodoro session is completed
- A short break is completed
- A long break is completed

If no sound file is present, the application will use a fallback beep sound generated with the Web Audio API.
